# CF-AutoScaler

This is an incubation project for Cloud Foundry. You can follow the development progress on [Pivotal Tracker][t].

The `CF-AutoScaler` provides the capability to adjust the computation resources for Cloud Foundry applications through

* Dynamic scaling based on application performance metrics
* Scheduled scaling based on time

The `CF-AutoScaler` is provided as a Cloud Foundry service offering. Any application bound with `CF-AutoScaler` service will be able to use it.

## Getting Started

System requirements:

* Java 8 or above
* [Apache Maven][b] 3
* [Apache couchdb][c]
* [Cloud Foundry cf command line] [f]
* [Cloud Foundry UAA command line client][u]

Database requirement:

The `CF-AutoScaler` uses Apache couchdb as the backend data store. You can have your own database installation from [Apache couchdb web site][c] or use an exisiting couchdb service, for example [Cloudant][e]


To get started, clone this project:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/app-autoscaler.git
$ cd app-autoscaler
```

The AutoScaler has three components, all of them them are Java Web Applications.

* `api` : provides public APIs to manage scaling policy, retrive application metrics, and scaling history. See details in [API_usage.rst][a]
* `servicebroker`: implements the [Cloud Foundry service broker API][k]
* `server`: the backend engine of `CF-AutoScaler`



`CF-AutoScaler` invokes Cloud controller API to trigger scaling on target application. To achieve this, a UAA client id with  authorities `cloud_controller.read,cloud_controller.admin` is needed for the Cloud Foundry environment `CF-AutoScaler` is registered with. You can create it using UAA command line client, make sure the client ID and secret are the ones you configured when you package the .war files

```shell
uaac target http://uaa.<cf-domain>
uaac token client get admin -s <cf uaa admin secret>
uaac client add cf-autoscaler-client \
	--name cf-autoscaler \
    --authorized_grant_types client_credentials \
    --authorities cloud_controller.read,cloud_controller.admin \
    --secret cf-autoscaler-client-secret
```

The following sections describe how to test, deploy and run `CF-AutoScaler` service manually.

### Run Unit Tests

For all these three `CF-AutoScaler` components, a unit test `unittest.properties` under 'profiles' directory has been created to define the settings for unit test.

To run all the unit tests, launch mvn test.
```shell
mvn test -Denv=unittest
```

To run a specific project's unittest, launch mvn test for the project and its dependencies. For example, to run unit test for the service broker component:
```shell
mvn test -Denv=unittest -pl common,servicebroker
```

### Configure and Package

All the `CF-AutoScaler` components are configured through a single properties file. To create your own settings, copy the following properties and change the appropriate values for your environment.

```
# CloudFoundry settings
cfUrl=api.my.domain
cfClientId=cf-autoscaler-client
cfClientSecret=cf-autoscaler-client-secret

# Service broker settings
serviceName=CF-AutoScaler
brokerUsername=admin
brokerPassword=admin

# http basic authentication settings between the CF-Autoscaler components
internalAuthUsername=admin
internalAuthPassword=admin

# scaling and api server URI settings
scalingServerURIList=https://autoscaling.my.app.domain
apiServerURI=https://autoscalingapi.my.app.domain

# couchdb settings
couchdbUsername=autoscaler
couchdbPassword=openopen
couchdbHost=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
couchdbPort=5984
couchdbServerDBName=couchdb-scaling
couchdbMetricDBPrefix=couchdb-scalingmetric
couchdbBrokerDBName=couchdb-scalingbroker

# metrics settings
reportInterval=120
```

Assume you want to name your environment, "myenv". Create a properties file in `app-autoscaler/profiles/myenv.properties` with all the properties defined above.

To package all the .war files for deployment, use mvn package. The *.war file can be found in each folder `{project}/target` directory.

```shell
mvn clean package -Denv=myenv -DskipTests
```

### Deploy `CF-AutoScaler` service

Push the .war package of each `CF-AutoScaler` components to Cloud Foundry to deploy `CF-AutoScaler` service.

The deployment assumes that there is a couchdb instance available with the configured host, port, username and password, and the couchdb can be accessed from an application running within Cloud Foundry.

```shell
bin/deploy.sh myenv
```

### Register `CF-AutoScaler` service broker

Register `CF-AutoScaler` with Cloud Foundry.

```shell
bin/registerService.sh myenv
```

## Test your 'CF-AutoScaler' deployment
See [src/acceptance/README.md](src/acceptance/README.md)

## Use `CF-AutoScaler`

Now, you can play with `CF-AutoScaler`.
Firstly create a `CF-AutoScaler` service, and bind to you application

```shell
cf create-service CF-AutoScaler free <service_instance>
cf bind-service <app> <service_instance>
```

Then refer to [API_usage.rst][a] to manage the scaling policy of your application, retrieve metrics and scaling histories.

## Tips for development
1. Run `cf logs` against the 3 servers when running tests if you need to see
   the actual errors reported. It is sometimes useful to `cf restart` the
   applications to see any errors that may have occurred during start.
1. Depending on where you deploy CouchDB, the AutoScaler service container's
   may not have network connectivity to it. To allow access, create and bind
   a security group.

```shell
cat > my-security-group.json <<EOF
[
  {
    "protocol": "tcp",
    "destination": "0.0.0.0/0",
    "ports": "5984"
  }
]
EOF

cf create-security-group couchdb my-security-group.json
cf bind-running-security-group couchdb
```
Restart the applications if needed
